# Sonar Kripke Structures

This repository contains Kripke structures related to the "Verifiable Executable Models for Decomposable Real-Time Systems" paper presented at MODELSWARD 2022.

Each Kripke structures comes in 3 formats:

1. an smv file for use with [https://nuxmv.fbk.eu/](NuXmv),
2. a gv file formatted in the [https://graphviz.org/](graphviz) dot format,
3. an svg image file generated by graphviz.

We recommed viewing the gv files and svg files using [http://zvtm.sourceforge.net/zgrviewer.html#:~:text=ZGRViewer%20is%20a%20graph%20visualizer,or%20others%20such%20as%20twopi.](ZGRViewer).
